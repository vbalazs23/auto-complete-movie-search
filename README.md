# auto-complete-movie-search
### [See it in work here](https://vbalazs23.github.io/auto-complete-movie-search/)
It's a small project that uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to display search results as the user types. It uses the movie database,
so don't try to search for shows. 
### Why on Earth would I do this?
I originally wanted to create an autocomplete search bar but this version seemed much more interesting as I started to research and think about the actual project more.
<br>
Especially as a lot of streaming sites use this kind of search method so I thought it would be cool to play with it.
<br>
I wanted to discover options on how to implement searching while the user types without overloading an API/database with requests. So I researched debouncing and throttling
and ended up using debounce here as it was more fitting.

P.S. The design is 2007 as hell.. I know I know... It wasn't the main focus here.
